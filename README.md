<i>An application based on MVC pattern.</i>

This is an application from Android Programming: The Big Nerd Ranch Guide book.
I tried to do all the excercises while reading this book. 
This is my version of application with actual <i><b>Kotlin</b></i> methods.

I learned how the MVC pattern works, a lot of information about Kotlin, about Android architecture, Android features etc.
